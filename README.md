# Controller Stamp

This is a proof-of-concept code generator that prints out code for a reconciler
as might be generated by [OperatorSDK](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/).

The idea is that bootstrapping reconciliation for secondary resources should be
quick. Go-based operators should have a starting point that isn't "an empty
reconcile func".

A full list of supported secondary resources can be found [here](resource/resource.go).

A full list of supported templates can be found [here](template/template.go).


It is up to the developer to fill in their secondary resource spec as a function
of their primary resource's spec, and setup the controller with the manager.
